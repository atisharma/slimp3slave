slimp3slave

slimp3slave is a console application implementation of a SLIMP3 client.
It was written to avoid the irritating lag that you get when pointing an
MP3 player at the http://.../stream.mp3 stream.

slimp3slave makes use of a command line MP3 player that reads from
standard input.  I recommend madplay, or failing that splay.  mpg123
is not recommended as it does not handle partial frames gracefully.

To use slimp3slave, type make, then run slimp3slave optionally
specifying the server IP address:

    ./slimp3slave -s 1.2.3.4

For more information:

    ./slimp3slave -h

To run slimp3slave with the UI enabled, using the "-l" option.  To start
slimp3slave in its own window, try:

    xterm -geometry 42x5 -e slimp3slave -l -s 1.2.3.4

slimp3slave was originally written as an audio-only client by Paul
Warren <pdw@ex-parrot.com> and has since been extending to include a UI
implentation using curses by Rob Funk <rfunk@funknet.net>.
